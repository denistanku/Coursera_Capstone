In this project I am going to analyze location data for the city of Munich in Germany, particulary distribution of gyms around the city. This will be of huge interest for investors/business owners looking to open a gym somewhere in the city. I will collect location data of currently existing gyms and population data for every borough of Munich, so that I can pinpoint one or multiple spots in the city where gym density is low and population density is relatively high. The final product of the project will be a detailed report supported by the datasets found which will defend a hypothesis about investing on a new gym in a certain spot of the city of Munich.
